    <h5>Hi! We’re Camptocamp, and we love maps.</h5>
    <p>
      It all started over 20 years ago with an Open Source project for
      outdoor enthusiasts—camptocamp.org—and we’ve been mapping ever since.
      These days, we create smart, beautiful, and reliable maps for all
      kinds of clients: governments, non-profits, and companies of every
      shape and size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission? To help people explore, understand, and navigate the
      world through intuitive, accurate, and innovative mapping tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also believe work should come with a good dose of fun, which is how
      Geo Challenge was born. At first, it was just an in-house challenge to see
      who knew their home country best. But then the competitive spirit
      kicked in, and we thought: why keep all this fun to ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      And while maps are our first love, they’re not our only one. We’re
      also a Gold Partner for the Open Source ERP software Odoo, and we keep
      IT infrastructures running smoothly so our clients can focus on what
      they do best. Our diverse set of skills are all united by our
      commitment to Open Source IT philosophy and our passion for creating
      digital experiences that are human and made to last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious about what we do or thinking about working together?

        Let us know. We’ll be in touch!
